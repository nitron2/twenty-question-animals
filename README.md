# Quick Start Guide:

1. Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.11.1/node-v20.11.1.pkg
2. Install XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/
3. Our database is located in the "database" directory, which is within this directory. Copy that databse folder to "/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/var/mysql/" Note: You may need to start XAMPP mySQL server for the first time in order to see the /var folder.
4. Start the Apache and mySQL servers in XAMMP (for Mac, this will be called "manager-osx" with a gear icon)
5. Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ 
6. Whenever you make changes to the database, copy the folder into database directory. This will allow us to collaborate on the database.

## To run an application, type 'nodemon app.js'. This way you can see changes in real time.
